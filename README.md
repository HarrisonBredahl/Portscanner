# Portscanner
Basic Port Scanner VIA Python
Please be aware that you should only port scan networks that you
are responsible for, or with permission of the network administrators,
Actions such as port scanning can be seen as a precursor to hacking as
you are looking for open ports on network devices. To avoid any issues,
just enter the name of your PC, or a PC on your home network.
